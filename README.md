# Garduino Project
The web App can :
1) talk to an  IoT platform { ThingSpeak } that
stores data sent from an arduino device.
the arduino used in this project can measure real-life values 
such as : 
    soil moisture
    air humidity 
    air temperature
    light intensity
 
2) Visualize all the measurements - soil moisture air humidity ... - using an area chart.

3) send a Text message to an arduino inorder to start an operation for example activate the pump responsible on watering the plant

4) provide a briefe weather forecast.
